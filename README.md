## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- OpenFOAM v2412 or later
- Standard OpenFOAM development environment
- C++ compiler (GCC/Clang)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tian-pvam/HVAC-for-OpenFOAM.git
cd HVAC-for-OpenFOAM

# IMPORTANT: Build order matters due to dependencies

# 1. First, install the humidity library into OpenFOAM source
cd $FOAM_SRC/thermophysicalModels/basic
# Add these lines to Make/files after liquidThermo.C:
# humidityRhoThermo/humidityRhoThermo.C
# humidityRhoThermo/humidityRhoThermos.C 
# humidityRhoThermo/derivedFvPatchFields/fixedHumidity/fixedHumidityFvPatchScalarField.C
wmake libso

# 2. Build CFD solvers with humidity support
cd $FOAM_RUN/../HVAC-for-OpenFOAM/buoyantHumidityPimpleFoam && wmake
cd ../buoyantHumiditySimpleFoam && wmake

# 3. Build comfort analysis utilities
cd ../comfortFoam && wmake
cd ../UTCIFoam && wmake
cd ../ASHRAE55 && wmake

# 4. Build boundary conditions
cd ../buildingElementBC && wmake

# 5. Build additional utilities as needed
cd ../AoAFoam && wmake
cd ../solarCalculator && wmake libso
cd ../windDrivenRainFoam && wmake
```

### Basic Usage Example

```bash
# Run a humidity test case
cd humidityRhoThermo/tutorials/laminar/fixedHumidityBC
./clean  # Clean previous results
./run    # Run mesh conversion and solver
paraFoam # Visualize results

# Post-process with comfort analysis
comfortFoam  # Calculates PMV, PPD, DR indices
UTCIFoam     # Calculates UTCI index
ASHRAE55Foam # ASHRAE-55 compliance check
```

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Humidity Modeling
The humidity transport is integrated into OpenFOAM's thermophysical framework through:
- Extended equation of state with humidity effects
- Humidity-dependent thermophysical properties
- Custom boundary conditions (e.g., `fixedHumidity`)
- Fields: relative humidity, specific humidity, water vapor partial pressure

### Comfort Calculations
All comfort tools follow established standards:
- **ISO 7730**: Fanger's PMV/PPD model with local draft rating
- **UTCI**: 6th-order polynomial approximation with radiation effects
- **ASHRAE-55**: Adaptive comfort model for naturally ventilated spaces
